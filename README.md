  - We have discovered an issuenwithin osTicket about 30 mintues ago! A few clients called and asked for an update concerning some Help Desk Tickets they submitted. After many attempts, our Lead Agent was unable to locate the tickets. Afterwards, the Lead Agent submitted a "Test" ticket via the Support Center portal and was unable to locate the "Test" ticket as well! Tickets are being created successfully but our Agents are unable to see them. The Help Desk Manager has exclated the issue to our Admin Team. Lets go solve this issue!    
</p>
<p>
  - Go to the Admin / Agent Portal for osTicket. (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php)
</p>
<p>
  - Log in as an Admin. Username: "adminuser" | Password: Password1
</p>

<p>
  - Upon further investigation, we discovered that a recent update caused a bug with a preset Department within osTicket. The bug is causing the tickets to be sent to the Maintenance Department regardless of the configurations. We will delete this department to get operations back to normal while osTicket works on a patch! 
</p>
<p>
  - From the Admin Panel, click -> Agents -> Departments. 
</p>
<p>
  - Check the box by Manitenance. Click the More dropdown arrow. Click Delete from the dropdown menu.

</p>
<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes our project. We have successfully navigated through the life cycle of a Help Desk ticket within osTicket. This project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end lifecycle of a Help Desk ticket using osTicket, from creation to resolution. Through this hands-on experience, we explored key aspects of ticketing systems, including ticket submission & categorization, workflow management (assignment, prioritization, SLA compliance), and resolution & closure processes
</p>
<p>
I recommend taking the time to play around in osTicket by creating and working different tickets. Use your imagination and have fun being your own Help Desk! Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one!
